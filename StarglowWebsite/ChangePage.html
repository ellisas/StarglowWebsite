                        Cut down on light usage. It’s simple! Turn off lights when you leave the room, use motion sensors on outside lights rather than keeping them on all night.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Control light trespass. When buying outdoor lights make sure you are using an appropriate voltage and light coverage for the area you want to light. Ideally, lights would have shields to minimize light trespass.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Using the right lights - colour matters! Blue light illuminate the night sky the most - this means that using LEDs and white light sources are not ideal. Lights with less blue light and warmer colours are preferred such as LPS or HPS lights are

                    <p>We can’t to it all ourselves. The big companies with no respect to the natural environment are even more responsible for the increase of light pollution. Company buildings that keep their lights on all night, use inapproprite outdoor light 
                        tures, neon lights and LED billboards are all contributors to light pollution.

                        <br>
                        LED street lights have be popularised and favoured over light pollution friendly options like LPS and HPS lighting. Streetlights lack shields and illuminate more than needed and have light trespasses to the sky. If we implement LPS lighting with properly shielding, we can make huge step towards decreasing light pollution.
